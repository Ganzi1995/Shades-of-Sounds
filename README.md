# Shapes-of-Sounds
Shapes of Sounds is a project based on the experimentation of shapes, sounds, and movement. This journey represents the culmination of my past works where I started to learn more about geometry, math, coding, and movement.
Here are the links:

Shades and Sounds showcases the outcome of a variety of examples combined using shapes, music, and movement via P5js, 
mainly FFT (Fast Fourier transform), which allowed me to experiment and explore how I could communicate the sound and movement via forms. It also allowed me to integrate human movement with geometric forms to showcase how closely related humans and geometry are. The aim of this project is to give geometric forms life and showcase how art can be beautifully integrated with maths. Also I wanted to integrate my website link to shocase the prcocess of this project:

&nbsp;

As the project was made in P5js, I created a webpage that showcases the three main collections, each containing three subfolders with different types of experiments. Within these pages, I included as many experiments as possible to give viewers the opportunity to fully immerse themselves in this journey.

* _FFT- Music and Shapes_  
Here, you will find examples that demonstrate the relationship between sounds and geometric forms.

* _FFT - Particle System and Movement_
<br> Here, you will find examples that demonstrate the relationship between the particle system and movement. It was intriguing to create a distinct scenario that deviated from the FFT's style. Connecting these two different coding worlds together was a fascinating endeavor.

* _FFT - Oswin Tickler_ 
  <br> Here are examples that demonstrate the relationship between colors and geometric forms. Although there is no direct connection between music and forms, it is crucial to understand that by changing colors and randomly positioning the shapes, a sense of movement and animation can still be achieved.

  * _FFT - Facemesh_
     <br> Here, I wanted to demonstrate the fascinating nature of working with sensors, particle systems, and movement. Despite the absence of music in the background, these experiments remain connected to the others through their shared and distinct expressions of movement and shapes.
